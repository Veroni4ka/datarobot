The dataset for the project was taken from: http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/.
I reduced the dataset a little bit. It contains spam and ham text messages. The dataset is here: english.csv.
Using that dataset it can be possible to predict if new message is spam. 
This functionality is widely used in message and emails spam filters.
